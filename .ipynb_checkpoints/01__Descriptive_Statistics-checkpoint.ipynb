    "In this lesson, we'll clean and analyze the Titanic data set, and see if descriptive statistics can tell us anything interesting about the data set.  Along the way, we'll gain hands-on experience with industry-standard tools such as the `pandas` library in python. \n",

    "#### About the Data Set.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg the night of May 31st, 1911.  1503 people died--only 705 survived (could have been 706, but some people are door hogs).  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Titanic dataset is often used as an introduction to data analysis, especially for those interested in machine learning. Because we know who survived and who didn't, we can use the data on passengers to explore, look for trends that affect survival rate, and maybe even make some predictions on which passengers survived by looking at their data.   Today, we'll explore the Titanic dataset and get some real-world practice with cleaning and manipulating data.  \n",

    "For data processing in Python, you can't beat the `pandas` library.  Pandas is used for creating dataframes, which are reminiscent of tables or spreadsheets, but much more powerful and easy to use.  Pandas provides a clean, easy-to-use API for reading, manipulating, sorting, and slicing data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we have the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Use pandas to read-in and manipulate data.\n",
    "1.  Explore strategies for detecting outliers and dealing with missing (NaN) values\n",
    "1.  Answer questions about our data set using descriptive statistics.\n",
    "1.  Use pandas to slice our dataframe into smaller dataframes based on conditional logic (for instance, all female survivors under a certain age)\n",
